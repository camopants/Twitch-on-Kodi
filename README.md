FAQ
----------------

* I can't find the Twitch.tv add-on in the Kodi add-on manager!

> Make sure you are using at least Kodi 20 (Nexus).

* I'm having issues with the playback of streams (buffering, dropping, stuttering).

> This Add-on does not handle any aspect of the playback of Twitch streams (that would be the Kodi Video Player), it simply tells Kodi what to play.
> The Add-on does however provide Quality Options which may help if your internet connection / computer specs are below requirements for HD streams.
> Try making sure that the Kodi Add-on "InputStream Adaptive" is installed, and Adaptive Quality is enabled in Twitch.tv's Add-on settings.
